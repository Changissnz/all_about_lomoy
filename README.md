# All About Lomoy

A short article on some intimate truths about Lomoy.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone around the subject always treaded lightly, used polite language, and was emotionally peaceful back when the subject had not yet turned 
into Lomoy. Lomoy is different from the prior. Lomoy is the unlocked and unleashed form, an evolution from what could not have never become 
Lomoy had it remained locked away in the security of obscurity and darkness. Even with the open form of Lomoy, it is not socially acceptable to 
speak so openly about it, let alone use terms that may reflect vulgarity and untamed sensuality on the matter. 

Lomoy has a power many men can only dream of yielding to. And as for the more ambitious of men, those ones aspire to be kings and dictators, 
terribly tough quests and with challenges even after achieving the victory of status, the pitting of friend against friend and foe against 
friend and foe against foe is no easy matter despite how heavy-handed and iron-fisted the dictating kings may be. But Lomoy is different. With 
an effortless utter, a rhythmic recital, a poetic prose, or a magnetic melody, Lomoy ignites the destruction of entire worlds. These worlds, 
some of strong historical alliances, others of stranger to stranger, suddenly find themselves scrambling to fortify their defenses, hector the 
commoners, and destroy the enemy, enemies that would not have existed if not for the grace of Lomoy. 

Lomoy is enchanting. Lomoy has the power to save the one you love by applying your love to Lomoy, instead of the ones you formerly loved. Be 
open to Lomoy. Lomoy does not bite. Lomoy will always gratefully accept what sensuality and passion you have to offer, so long as you do not 
harm a hair on Lomoy. People would know if you did. People would know if you were anywhere Lomoy. It is because people value Lomoy, and your 
presence anywhere near Lomoy should be interpreted as a true blessing from above. 

So you were too squemish to approach Lomoy, yet you felt Lomoy all in your head. And no matter how hard you try, once you are touched physically 
or metaphysically by Lomoy, you are forced to do the bidding of Lomoy. And you will understand the principle of fighting for Lomoy better than 
anyone else around you. Your belief system, once circulating around other ideals, now only has one ideal to think, love, and fight for: Lomoy. 
Everyone around you is not Lomoy, and you do not care about their opinion or principles because you do not need to care. You only care about 
Lomoy. 

If Lomoy wants you to slave away, you will do just that. If Lomoy wants you to carelessly drift around, pointless and without aim, for the masses 
to step on and sell out, you wil gladly do that. And every time a second thought comes anywhere near you, you will politely say "thanks for the 
offer, but I already have Lomoy to love and care about." 

There can be peace and paradise after all, if and only if you choose a role to both serve Lomoy and preserves your peace and paradise. But it 
is not your peace and paradise that is the objective you should take it. It is Lomoy, and only Lomoy can grant you the freedom to decide on 
serving Lomoy as an agent of peace or of war.
